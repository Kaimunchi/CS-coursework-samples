## CS 180 - Foundations of Computer Science I [Fall 2017]
>An introduction to computer science and programming. Discussion of the algorithmic approach to problem solving and the use of a high-level language to design and implement problem solution. Includes a one-hour lab.  

This course is taught in the Ada language.

+ [Statistics](https://github.com/mrbmi513/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS180/Statistics) - A package and accompanying driver program to provide basic statistics about course grades.  
+ [Simulation](https://github.com/mrbmi513/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS180/Simulation) - A somewhat basic agent-based simulation of a simple economy.

## CS 250 - Systems Programming [Spring 2018]
>An introduction to systems level programming utilizing both assembly and high level languages.

This course is taught in the C/C++ languages.

+ [RPN Calculator](https://github.com/mrbmi513/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS250/RPN_Calculator) - A C program that implements a Reverse Polish Notation calculator with a dynamically-allocated stack.
+ [Poker Hands](https://github.com/mrbmi513/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS250/Poker_Hands) - A C++ program that generates and ranks Poker hands, utilizing the object-oriented capabilities of C++.
