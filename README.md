# Truman Coursework Samples
Here is a collection of programs from Computer Science courses I have taken at Truman State University. This repository will be updated at the end of each semester.

### A Note to Current Students
If you're a current student and ran across this repo, congrats! You've learned to use your resources! But use them responsibly, you must. I do not promote nor condone any misuse of this code for academic dishonesty, nor am I responsible for any consequences resulting from such misuse. Additionally, using this code without attribution also breaks the CC license's requirements, which may or may not have legal ramifications. You've been warned, young padawan.

## CS 180 - Foundations of Computer Science I [Fall 2017]
>An introduction to computer science and programming. Discussion of the algorithmic approach to problem solving and the use of a high-level language to design and implement problem solution. Includes a one-hour lab.  

This course is taught in the Ada language.

**Note:** This is *not* the updated version of the course, introduced in Fall 2018, that is taught in the C++ language.

+ [Statistics](https://git.brandoningli.com/brandon/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS180/Statistics) - A package and accompanying driver program to provide basic statistics about course grades.  
+ [Simulation](https://git.brandoningli.com/brandon/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS180/Simulation) - A somewhat basic agent-based simulation of a simple economy.

## CS 191 - Computing Structures [Spring 2018]
>Uses the computer as a tool to introduce discrete structures and techniques for computing. Analysis of algorithms, methods of proof, counting techniques, and discrete probability.

This course is a math-based course with some programming in the Prolog language.
+ [Assignment 1](https://git.brandoningli.com/brandon/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS191/ingli_1.pl) - Simple Prolog knowledgebase to solve logic problems in the course textbook.

## CS 250 - Systems Programming [Spring 2018]
>An introduction to systems level programming utilizing both assembly and high level languages.

This course is taught in the C/C++ languages, with references to x86 Assembly.

+ [RPN Calculator](https://git.brandoningli.com/brandon/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS250/RPN_Calculator) - A C program that implements a Reverse Polish Notation calculator with a dynamically-allocated stack.
+ [Poker Hands](https://git.brandoningli.com/brandon/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS250/Poker_Hands) - A C++ program that generates and ranks Poker hands, utilizing the object-oriented capabilities of C++.  

## CS 260 - Object Oriented Programming and Design [Fall 2018]
>A continuation of Foundations of Computer Science II. Event-driven programming, design patterns, collections, generics, graphical user interfaces, and an introduction to concurrent programming.

This course is taught in the Java language.

+ [FileSync](https://git.brandoningli.com/brandon/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS260/fileSync) - A Client/Server solution to back up files from one computer to another over the network.
+ [Multithreaded Fibonacci Prime](https://git.brandoningli.com/brandon/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS260/fib_prime) - A multithreaded program to calculate Fibonacci Prime numbers. Utilizes the `ExecutorService` and a custom thread-safe circular buffer utilizing `Lock` and `Condition`s

## CS 291 - Models of Computation [Fall 2018]
>Logic: propositional calculus, first-order predicate calculus. Formal reasoning: natural deduction, resolution. Applications to program correctness and automatic reasoning. Formal models of computation: regular languages, finite automata, grammars, pushdown automata, Turing machines, classes P and NP, uncomputability, the halting problem.

This course is a theory course with some programming in the Prolog language.

+ [String Processing/FA Project](https://git.brandoningli.com/brandon/truman-coursework-samples/tree/master/CS291/string_processing_fa) - A project I designed and led where students develop a regular expression for a string validation task, find an FA for that regular expression, and implement that FA in Prolog.
