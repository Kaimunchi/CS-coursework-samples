# CS 250 - Assignment 2  


Build a dynamically allocated stack and demonstrate its use in an RPN calculator.

Section 4.3 in the text outlines this calculator using an array as the stack.

You should use a struct node as shown in class and malloc and free appropriately to implement push and pop operations.  These should return 1 or 0 (true or false) depending on whether the operation was successful.  

Read an input string representing an RPN calculation into a character array and then use the dynamically allocated stack to perform the computation and output the correct answer.
