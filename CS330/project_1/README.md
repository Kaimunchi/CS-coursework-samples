# Project 1
Implement the given C program in MIPS assembly, under the following guidelines: 
* Store the array in the static data area. There will be no more than 100 elements in the array.
* Associate an s-register with each external variable and with the array address. They do not need to be stored in memory.
* You may use any MIPS instructions and pesudoinstructions talked about in class.
