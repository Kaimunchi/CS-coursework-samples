# Project 2
In the early days of desktop computing, CPUs were quite primitive. None of 
them supported floating point operations, or complex integer operations 
like exponentiation or remainder, and many did not even include instructions 
for integer multiplication.

We are going to write code to simulate the multiplication and exponentiation 
of non-negative integers using recursion. Translate the given C program 
into MIPS assembly language.

## What to turn in
Email the assembly source code file with the subject `<Lastname> - CS 330 - Project 2`.
Also print a copy to turn in during class.
